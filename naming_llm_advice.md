Sure, here is an example of how you can name your clusters and provide scripts for cleaning up each cluster's names in Python using `os` module which allows us to rename files/directories at runtime as well as handle file paths more easily than just strings concatenation or string formatting. 

**Table: Cluster Naming & Recommended Names (Current -> Recommendations)**  
| Current Name | Canonical Name |  Python Scripts for Refactoring  | Flags of Dangerous Ambiguity/Config Drift?   | TODO Checklist Item(s)| 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
[Park Cluster](https://example.com/parks.csv, https://example.com/teams.csv -> park_cluster , Python: `os.rename('old-park', 'new-folder')`; sed script not required for this cluster | No | 1) Check if the old names are still used in other places (if any); 2) Update all references to new name(s).  |
[Team Cluster](https://example.com/teams.csv, https://example.com/parks.csv -> team_cluster , Python: `os.rename('old-team', 'new-folder')`; sed script not required for this cluster | No | 1) Check if the old names are still used in other places (if any); 2) Update all references to new name(s).  |
[MLB Parks Cluster](https://example.com/mlb_parks.csv, https://example.com/mlb_teams.csv -> mlb_park_cluster , Python: `os.rename('old-team', 'new-folder')`; sed script not required for this cluster | No | 1) Check if the old names are still used in other places (if any); 2) Update all references to new name(s).  |
[MLB Teams Cluster](https://example.com/mlb_teams.csv, https://example.com/mlb_parks.csv -> mlb_team_cluster , Python: `os.rename('old-park', 'new-folder')`; sed script not required for this cluster | No | 1) Check if the old names are still used in other places (if any); 2) Update all references to new name(s).  |
[Final Predictions Cluster](https://example.com/final_preds_* -> final_predictive_models , Python: `os.rename('old-name', 'new-folder')`; sed script not required for this cluster | No | 1) Check if the old names are still used in other places (if any); 2) Update all references to new name(s).  |
[TODO](https://example.com/final_preds_* -> final_predictive_models , Python: `os.rename('old-name', 'new-folder')`; sed script not required for this cluster | No | 1) Check if the old names are still used in other places (if any); 2) Update all references to new name(s).  |
  
Please note that these scripts should be run manually, and they will only rename files/directories. If you want a script for renaming directories as well or moving data between clusters without changing the names of existing ones in your codebase (i.e., preserving all references), then it would require more complex handling than simple file name changes can provide due to potential naming conflicts and other factors that could affect how different parts of your project interact with each other, such as database connections or shared resources between clusters/clusters within a larger system like an ML pipeline.
